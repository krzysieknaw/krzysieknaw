- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kris
- I work in support of civil engineering (automation, BIM, etc)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science - actualy student of postgraduate studies in Universyty of Science and Technology (known as AGH - KrakÃ³w, Poland) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Python! I've known it for a few years, but each project gives me a chance to do something in a new way - faster and better.

- What I'm glad I know:
- Django (my "great discovery" in Python) /n
  SQL (prefer Postgresq)
  HTML & CSS (enough to work with it)
  I wish I could put JS here, but my level is... let's say "basic". Maybe someday...
