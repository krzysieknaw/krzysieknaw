### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kris
I work in support of civil engineering (spatial data, automation, BIM, etc)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **Data Science** - actualy I'm a student of postgraduate studies in Universyty of Science and Technology (known as AGH in KrakÃ³w, Poland) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... **Python**! I've known it for a few years, but each project gives me a chance to do something faster, better or just in a new way.

- What I'm glad I know:
  - **Django** (my "great discovery" in Python)
  - SQL (prefer **Postgresq**)
  - **HTML** & **CSS** (enough to work with it)
  - VBA (sometimes there is just no need to reinvent the wheel)
  - R (just for statistics; I'm not great fan)
  - I wish I could put JS here, but my level is... let's say "basic". Maybe someday...
